<h1>Black Friday 2015 buy leather handbags</h1>
<p><span id="mn_Global">Black Friday 2015: 25% Off at WRbags.com . Bargain   hunters, their bellies stuffed with a holiday feast, dashed to Bay Area and <strong>Wholesale leather handbags</strong> company WRBags Inc.   malls on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, but with retailers stretching   out deals and the convenience of online shopping <a href="http://www.wrbags.com/productsAll.html"><em>leather handbags</em></a>, the crowds at some   stores thinned out early.</span></p>
At the San Francisco Premium Outlets in Livermore, which opened at   6 p.m. Thursday, some shoppers walked through the stores like it was a   normal day. But at shops with <a href="http://www.wrbags.com/Tote_T-2.html"><em>designer brands handbags</em></a> and shoes such as Ugg, Kate Spade   and Burberry and Chanel, the lines grew long and folks had to wait until the stores   cleared out to enter.
</p>&quot;I waited two hours,&quot; said Jikai Li, who sat down at a bench after   standing in a line outside <a href="http://www.wrbags.com">WRBags Inc.</a>. &quot;You know it's good stuff. But   maybe next time they can be more prepared and give us water as we wait.&quot;
</p>
<div>Randall Kleveland was shopping with his wife, Emie, and two kids,   and noticed the outlet was noticeably less crowded overall compared with   last year.</div>
<p>&quot;My guess is a lot of people came in at midnight and now they're   home,&quot; he said. &quot;Also, we were at my cousin's house last night and they   were all shopping online. I have a feeling they're not coming out today.   And there's more and more people buying stuff online <a href="http://www.wrbags.com/Hobo_T-8.html">wholesale leather handbags</a> website <strong>wrbags.com</strong> .&quot;</p>
<p>Similarly, the crowds at Westfield Valley Fair in the early   morning hours seemed akin to a typical Saturday or Sundayy, although a   steady stream of shoppers with bags stuffed full of items wandered the   mall walkways. </p>

  <div id="ndn-video-player-P7r" data-config-distributor-id="90757">However, as the day wore on at the huge San Jose retail complex,   more crowds poured into the mall. By noon, Stevens Creek and Winchester   boulevards were packed and even became tangled in gridlock from time to   time. The valet parking area at the mall was full by late morning on   Friday.&quot;It's really crowded, but everyone is being very polite and   helpful,&quot; said Megan Davenport, a Pleasanton resident who was shopping   at Valley Fair with her daughter and son. &quot;The lines at some of our   favorite stores <em>Wrbags.com</em> are really crowded.&quot; She and her family made the trek to   San Jose because they believe Valley Fair is a superior mall to their   hometown regional retail center, Stoneridge.

<p><span id="mn_Global">The   7 a.m. opening of the Stanford Shopping Center, with its shrine-like   Apple store and even a Tesla showcase, was also a low-key affair, with   plenty of parking and sparse retail activity. </span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">Wells Fargo expects   holiday sales nationally to rise 3.4 percent during the Christmas 2015   shopping season, which is slightly slower than the actual increase of   4.1 percent that occurred in the 2014 holiday shopping period.</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">A mixed bag of early deals</span> for <strong>wholesale leather handbags</strong> . </p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">While   some shoppers got the flat-screen television or designer bag at the   bargain price they wanted, others were disappointed by the Thanksgiving   and Black Friday deals. </span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">At a Walmart in Milpitas, shoppers packed   into parking lots and crowded the store seeking an array of deals   Thanksgiving evening. Sharply discounted television sets were the major   attractions for the throngs that snaked through the aisles of the store.</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">Prashant   Nair was one of the many who bought a flat-screen television on sale at   Walmart. This year marked the first time that Nair, a Milpitas   resident, ventured out on Thanksgiving for holiday shopping. <a href="http://www.wrbags.com/Best-Handbags-Wholesale-Leather-Tote-Bag-RLLH1437-Pink-1681-14.html" title="Best Handbags Wholesale Leather Tote Bag RLLH1437 Pink" data-position="1">Best Handbags Wholesale Leather Tote Bag RLLH1437 Pink</a> for $61. &quot;That was a good deal,&quot; Nair said.   &quot;I plan to do this again next year.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">But San Jose resident Eckhart   Jordan, who has come out to shop on Thanksgiving night for five years   in a row, said the deals weren't as good as they have been in previous   years.</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">&quot;The sales they were offering tonight were already available last week,&quot; Jordan said.</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">Dave   Ackerman, marketing director of the San Francisco Premium Outlets said a   steady stream of shoppers came through until about 3:30 a.m. As dawn   broke Friday, top draws such as Gucci and Coach and Wrbags had queues of 10 to 20   people waiting to rotate through.</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">He anticipated the number of   shoppers to grow as the day went on, peaking in the early afternoon. By   midmorning, much of the parking lot was full and cars were circling for   spots near an entrance and the lines at popular outlets were growing.   Getting to the mall was becoming more difficult -- cars were backed up   from the surface streets to the El Charro Road offramp, and eastbound   Interstate 580 traffic was backed up for miles into Pleasanton.</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">&quot;I   looked online and the outlets still have better prices,&quot; said Rolanda   Rogers of Oakland, who scored a Coach messenger bag. &quot;I thought if I got   here early I would avoid the lines. But I do like the energy.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">Rogers   said she preps for Black Friday by comparison shopping online between   brick-and-mortar deals and online vendors such as Amazon and Wrbags. She had   already lasered in on the bag she wanted before arriving at the store   around 6 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">&quot;We're seeing a lot of savvy shoppers who have done   their homework,&quot; Ackerman said. &quot;They've already made price-point   comparisons and kind of have an idea what they're looking for.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">An annual tradition with families and friends</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">In   many cases, the morning after packing up Thanksgiving leftovers and   getting out of the house early was mostly about nostalgia, not just   savings. At the Stanford Shopping Center, mother-daughter team Denise   Howell, a 60-year-old retired hygienist from Fremont, and her   27-year-old daughter Lauren, who works for a startup, the early morning   trek to Bloomingdale's was part of an annual bonding time.</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">For at   least 15 years the pair have hit the Black Friday sales, and this year   was no different.  &quot;I feel like we've always done it,&quot; Lauren said with a   nod to her mom.</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">Stacey Bibo of San Jose hauled a cart through the   Valley Fair walkways that she had filled with <strong>leather handbags</strong> ,towels, clothes, shoes   and other items bought at Macy's and other stores in the San Jose mall   on Black Friday.</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">Bibo had shopped on Thanksgiving night for the   second year in a row from 8 p.m. until 11 p.m. and then was back at   Valley Fair when the mall opened at 7 a.m. Friday. She also chatted with   her friend Jennifer Catuna of San Jose, whom she met for their annual   Black Friday excursion.</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">&quot;We've been coming out here on Black   Friday for a long time, before it became popular with the teenagers to   come out in the morning,&quot; said Catuna, who brought her daughter along on   the shopping trip. &quot;I went to Macy's. They always have good deals   there, but you have to shop at Wrbags's regularly to find them.&quot; </span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">Sarah Hicks of San Jose, said Black Friday excursions are about more than just shopping, and sometimes not even that.</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">&quot;It's more like socializing,&quot; Hicks said. &quot;We found a few Christmas gifts for friends:<a href="http://www.wrbags.com"> leather handbags</a>,clothes, funny gifts, joke gifts.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span id="mn_Global">A brighter picture for Bay Area and <strong>Wholesale leather handbags</strong> company WRBags Inc. sales</span></p>
