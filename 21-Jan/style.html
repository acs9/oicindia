<h1>100%  genuine leather handbags</h1>
<p>How to know your<strong> leather handbag</strong>s is made of the <strong>real leather</strong>?General speaking, when we talk about cow hide leather, we means the cow skin taken from cattle or buffalo bodies.<br />
The  leather is cut from the cow, and then through a series of aquatic   skin  from wet to dry. Then we make from the dried skin of embryonic   various  styles of products involved in leather industry. <br />
Recent years, cow hide leather is widely used in various industries. <br />
Cow hide is more common used in shoes, <a href="http://www.wrbags.com/Other-colors_C-92.html"><em>leather handbags</em></a> purses, belts and other leather goods  <br />
There  are also many other industries in the use of leather products,    including crocodile pattern, ostrich pattern, serpentine, pearls, and    other characteristics with Fish Process.</p>
<p>We <strong>wholesale sheep leather handbags </strong>too.Sheep  skin is   characterized by grain oblate pores, deeply steeper in leather,  pores   clear, a few lined up a group, very like the scale or jagged  array.   Pattern features, such as &quot;ripple&quot;-like. Sheepskin light, thin,  soft,   is ideal for leather clothing fabric, garments made of beautiful    patterns, soft gloss natural, soft, thin, flexible, just not as strong    as cowhide and pigskin. </p>
<p>How to distinguish sheep skin from lamb skin?  Below is their difference  <br />
  Sheep  skin: more fat content in the cortex, the skin loose fibrous   tissue is  very soft, smooth and fine grain, large extension, but not   strong. <br />
  Lamb skin is the cortex of fat less fibrous tissue than the full sheep skin pores clear, flexible leather, solid and durable.</p>
<p>Our <strong>Handbags factory</strong> ,Crocodile  are a smaller and less expensive   alternative to their larger cousins in  nature (the crocodile and   alligator. Semi-glazed caiman belly hides  have a smooth texture and a   unique shiny finish unmatched by matte  quality skins). Crocodile is   widely used in leather handbags,  purses, wallets and belts. The belly   hide has the soft, smoother  underside of the caiman in the center of   that material while the thicker  ridges stretch across the outer rims.</p>
<p>Natural  Python skin: Hand painted python   hides offer limitless options on  painted colored accents across the   finished hide. Hand painting creates a  wild exotic look while still   retaining a lot of the natural snake  patterns that make python skin so   fascinating and recognizable. Python  leather is strong and comfortable   for garments, purses and<a href="http://www.wrbags.com/Wallet_P-87.html"><em> leather handbags</em></a>.    equally attractive in upholstery applications like car interiors,   sofa,  trims. No two snake patterns are exactly the same and hand   painted  mosaic python always adds a new unique element in style and   fashion. <br />
Leather in python effect also always hot in leather handbags and purses collection.</p>
<p>Horsehide  was formerly a utility leather,   but it is now far too costly. Their  hides have become very hard to   source, and most tanneries will no longer  handle them.<br />
Horsehide generally is finer grained than cowhide and  takes on a little   more pleasing luster with use. However, horse can be  stiffer and take   longer to break in than cow, and some find it less  durable.</p>
<p>Ostrich  Skin: Ostrich leather is smooth,   flexible, and naturally oily – as the  skin absorbs more oil, the hide   becomes softer and more brilliant.  Ostrich hides have a smooth surface   and in the center, approximately  half of its surface is covered with   the signature quill pock marks that  ostrich leather is known for.</p>
<p>Lizard  Skin: Lizard hides have a smooth   stippled texture and a shiny finish.  Strong and unique, yet its smaller   size often requires larger quantities  for production. So it is really   an expensive and rare skin for leather  handbags and purses production.We do <strong>customers designer handbags</strong> too. </p>
<p>Zebra  skin are rated Grade and are shipped   from South Africa to the United  States where a fine felt backing is   applied. The felt backing is  particularly useful and recommended if you   intend for the zebra hide to  be laid out as a rug. The felt adds extra   support and weight to keep it  laying flat on the floor. <br />
Zebra hide is hand selected and professionally backed with fine, high quality felt. Now most of the<a href="http://www.wrbags.com/Vintage_C-95.html"><em> leather handbags </em></a>and purses are made of the cow leather in zebra effect.</p>
