<p>If you live in the US and the idea of ordering a bag from a site outside   the country makes you a bit nervous, I can’t blame you. <strong>Best wholesale handbags</strong> are   already expensive, and figuring out how a retailer deals with duties,   international shipping and foreign purchase fees when you’re not   well-versed in the rules can be a little bit daunting; <strong>discount handbags wholesale</strong>,no one wants to   accidentally spend hundreds of dollars more than they expected if it’s   not necessary. Because some of our favorite online retailers are in   other countries, though, we did some digging in order to demystify the   process.<br />
  <br />
International shopping has advanced by leaps and bounds over the past   few years. Almost all luxury retailers include a bag’s import duties   (which are what a buyer would owe to US Customs for importing a product   into the US) in the prices listed on their website, and almost all of   them do it without charging you more for the bag than you’d pay in the   US <strong>handbags wholesalers</strong>. Many also offer free or very affordable shipping and returns, which   help make the whole thing feel like you’re ordering from a company <strong>handbags wholesalers</strong> a few   states away instead of on the other side of the globe. If you got   burned buying a bag from an international retailer a few years ago,   whatever problem you had is much less likely to happen today.<br />
<br />
As for foreign purchase fees, it all depends on the credit card you use   with your order–that’s not something retailers set. Most cards have a   fee of around 3%, but there are cards available <strong>handbags wholesalers</strong> that won’t ding you at   all–it depends on the specific terms and conditions of your account, and   contacting your bank for more info is your best course of action.<strong>handbags wholesale prices</strong> are lowest. <br />
<br />
Foreign purchase fee aside, we’ve assembled the official shipping,   returns and duty policies of the Internet’s largest US-friendly <strong>handbags wholesalers</strong>  international retailers below. If we’ve missed your favorite, please let   us know!</p>
