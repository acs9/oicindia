		<strong>Harminder Singh: He can tell who is carrying out a recording </strong>
</p>
			<p >
			If someone is tapping your mobile phone or if someone is covertly using a hidden camera to watch all your activities, do not worry!  Certain gadgets are now available in the market that can tell you who around you is doing so.  In technical parlance, these are called de-bugging equipments, that is, equipments to detect recording devices.  Some private investigators have earned fame in this field alone and as such are doing brisk business.  Politicians afraid of ‘sting operations’ are taking a fancy for such equipments and are trying to learn how to use these gadgets.<br/><br/>
			In Delhi’s Vasant Vihar, Intelligence Network Agency run by Harminder Singh carries out similar operations.  According to him, for de-bugging operations two main equipments are required.  One is a RF frequency counter that displays the frequency on which the recording device is operating.  The other is a frequency detector that detects hidden wireless cameras, recorders or transmitters in a particular area.  The company, manufacturing such devices had at first come out with a bigger version of a detector that was priced between Rs.40,000 - Rs.45,000.   But now detectors of the size of lipsticks are available in the market and they cost between Rs.15,000 - Rs.20,000.  By keeping these in your pocket you can be rest assured that the moment it comes within the range of a listening device it will give an alarm to forewarn you.<br/><br/>
			According to Harminder Singh, buying such gadgets is neither expensive nor important, but what is important is the technical knowledge to know how to use themt.  For example, if someone uses these equipments without proper technical know how he would not be able to understand the frequency signals without which he will not be able to discern who has the concealed recorder or camera.  According to Harminder Singh, in addition to politicians, five star hotels and reputed guest houses also benefit from such equipments.  These equipments are also useful in exposing those individuals who secretly use hidden cameras to make pornographic films and propagate them through MMS.<br/><br/>
			Even in big corporate houses these equipments are in huge demand.  Companies with very high turnovers always fear that someone may be tempted by monetary gains to leak out confidential trade secrets.  According to Harminder, these companies hire such services before a meeting for launching a new product in the market or before a meeting where revision of prices of existing products is being discussed in order to know whether or not someone is eavesdropping on their meetings.</p>
