<h1>Wholesale leather handbags online </h1>
<p>Only for refurbishment or refinishing does <strong>cheap designer bags</strong> require that a bag be verified as purchased from a <strong>wholesale leather handbags </strong>boutique or authorized <strong>designer crossbody bags</strong> Multi-Brand Retailer. Proof of location of purchase is not required for other repairs.</p>
<p>As brands continue to raise the prices of their goods, customers who are willing to pay are going to expect more for their money, including quality and service. Many tPFers are particularly irritated that a brand like <strong>leather shoulder bags</strong> would adopt this kind of policy because of the timelessness of its bags; they’re meant to be used and enjoyed for many years, not just a season or two, which makes the five-year timeframe for repairs and refurbishing more puzzling.</p>
<p>And one final blow in the entire debacle is that the repairs department told a different poster who inquired that the brand will not treat your bag for refinishing or refurbishing if you have ever had it worked on by an outside refurbisher. This isn’t entirely shocking–brands like to work on their products and know who worked on them previously–but it is one more letdown for many <strong><a href="http://www.wrbags.com/100-Genuine-Crocodile-Leather_13.html">Real Leather handbags</a> </strong>owners.</p>
<p>Again, this is only for refinishing or refurbishing, as we cannot guarantee the final outcome if the bag has been previously treated with unknown products or treatments, which could risk damaging the bag.</p>
<p>I called <strong>wholease real leather bags</strong> to check on all of this, and they did confirm the change in policy. If you are worried about finding your receipt, <strong>wholesale bags</strong> company will be able to look you up in their system and find your purchase, which should take away some fears when it comes to proving original ownership. The person I spoke with explained <strong>wholesale fashion bag</strong> prides itself on being able to take care of a bag properly and bring it back to its original state, and that <strong>quality leather handbags</strong> would not want to cause additional damage to a bag that is older than 5 years and shows more age and wear during the refurbishing process. <strong>wholesale handbag suppliers</strong> must be fielding many calls about its new policy; each rep seems ready to answer if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a major letdown for <strong>discount leather handbags</strong> collectors and lovers, especially those who knew the previous policy and used it often. The luxury market continues to change, and with one of the most coveted brands choosing this direction, it will be interesting to see if and how it affects the market. </p>
<p>If you’ve been as fond of <strong>handbag wholesale suppliers</strong> handbags as we’ve been lately, we have some unfortunate news to share this morning. Raf Simons, <strong>made in italy bags</strong> much-lauded creative director of 3.5 years, has decided not to renew his contract with LVMH, the brand’s parent company, according to an announcement made yesterday in Paris.</p>
<p>The Cut’s Cathy Horyn, who has covered Simons’ career closely for years, has the most comprehensive analysis of the decision, and it’s clear this isn’t a case of a brand’s executives pressuring a designer to leave or be publicly fired. Horyn reports that LVMH execs have had nothing but praise for Simons and that his designs have driven a 60% increase in <strong>ladies purses</strong>’s sales since his arrival in 2011, as well as wide critical acclaim. Instead, by Horyn’s estimation, it seems as though Simons simply wants to do other, perhaps less stressful things; his motivations were described only as “personal reasons.”</p>
<p>Spring 2016, presented earlier this month in Paris, is Simons’ last collection for the brand, and LVMH has not named his successor, although the company will surely have the pick of the litter for such a coveted, high-profile role. We’re certainly going to miss Raf Simons’ influence on the brand’s bags, though.</p>
<p>Since joining the <strong>wholesale handbags suppliers</strong> staff in 2011, Simons has overseen an expansion of the brand’s handbag line, including design debuts like the <strong>wholesale handbags suppliers</strong>, <strong>wholesale clutch bags</strong> and Be <strong>leather bags</strong>, as well as an expanded<strong> Lady leather handbags wholesale </strong>line. The expansion, which was characterized by Simons’ modernism mixed with <strong>italian leather purse</strong> signature ladylike polish, was largely well-received, with a clear uptick in consumer interest (our now-very-busy <strong>leather handbags </strong>subform on the <a href="http://www.wrbags.com/productsAll.html"><strong>wrbags.com</strong></a> can attest to that) and more celebrities carrying the bags than ever, which tends to be influential on luxury shoppers.</p>
