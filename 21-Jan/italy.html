<p>While I love all of the bags we photographed, the <strong>Wholesale leather handbags</strong> Animalier   Shoulder Bag might be my favorite of the bunch. Between the compact size   and the cool tiger-head metal detail, this design is a winner. There is   a very laid-back feel to the bag, with its double-knotted straps that   go over your shoulder easily with a 10.5″ drop.<br />
  <br />
The interior of the bag features a Herbarium print linen lining and is   split into three areas, with a zipper compartment as the center divider.   Everyone knows I love interior compartments and separations (my <strong>Wholesale leather handbags</strong>   Bamboo Shopper is one of my favorite bags for this reason), so it’s easy   to see why this bag is so great. There are several colorways, but I   love the brown and emerald green/pink options.</p>
<p>Before Michele was <strong>Wholesale leather handbags</strong>’s creative director, he was the head of   accessories, and his attention to detail when it comes to bags is   evident when you open the Marmont. Two main areas sit alongside pouch   and zipper pockets, which make the interior just as beautiful as the   exterior. <strong>Wholesale leather handbags</strong> offers this bag in black, brown and red.<br />
As each of Michele’s new collections debuts, his understanding of the   brand’s heritage melds with his fresh take on <strong>Wholesale leather handbags</strong> signatures. You can   shop all <strong>Wholesale leather handbags</strong> items via the brand’s newly designed website online.</p>
<p>I was immediately drawn to the <strong>Wholesale leather handbags</strong> Dionysus Blooms Print Bags, as I   had already played with the Dionysus bags up close and loved them. For   those who were looking for an all-leather version of the Dionysus, this   is your option. Made in <strong>Wholesale leather handbags</strong> Blooms printed leather, this shoulder bag   has a textured tiger head spur closure and is available in both green   and red in two different sizes. The chain strap can be worn multiple   ways, so you can carry this bag as a shoulder bag or top handle.</p>
