<h1>Wholesale designer handbags</h1>
<p>The <strong>Wholesale leather handbags</strong> 2016 Collection will soon be available in boutiques this   November. <strong>Leather  handbags</strong> are made in python appear in different   colors like Green, Purple and Blue. The Paradise print which was first   seen in the runway show is featured in black and white<strong> leather bags</strong> , shoes and   accessories. The brand’s iconic <strong>Lady Leather Bag</strong> is also available in   feminine cherry blossom prints.</p>
<p>Because paparazzi tend to follow the young, lithe starlets of LA and New York, so does our coverage of which <strong><a href="http://www.wrbags.com/AboutUs.html">wholesale designer handbags</a></strong> celebrities are carrying--there's simply more photographic evidence to go on. When we started looking, though, we realized that because of her out-and-about life in NYC, we could piece together enough to create an in-depth look at the handbag choices of legendary journalist <strong>wholesale  walters</strong>. So we did just that.</p>
<p>Not only has <strong>leather hobo bags</strong>  career spanned more than a couple decades, but so has her life in New York's philanthropic and social circles, and we found that she regularly carries bags that she's clearly had for some time. That made it harder to identify some of her pieces, but we think you'll enjoy scoping them out, along with her higher-profile <strong>leather bags for women</strong> and Leather bags picks, just the same.</p>
<p>I find the idea of being followed everywhere by cameras dystopian and terrifying, but it's a reality that celebrities deal with daily and that some of them have been dealing with for years. From them, I have learned many things (keep your knees together when exiting an SUV in a dress!), but my most wrbags.com discovery is that many<strong> popular handbags</strong> are perfectly shapes to block your head from a camera.</p>
<p>This technique is currently in common use among the more camera-allergic glitterati, but its real heyday was the late-2000s, when gossip sites were booming and Perez Hilton doodling genitalia on Lindsay Lohan's face in MS Paint was something that happened multiple times per day. Theoretically, blocking yourself with your <a href="http://www.wrbags.com/productsAll.html">dkny handbags</a> makes the photos low-quality and less likely to be sold (and therefore disincentivizes photogs from following that particular star), but actually, people seem to love to look at photos of stars who don't want to be looked at. What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>Most recently, Gwyneth Paltrow has used the bag-block technique regularly, so we went through our photo archives to find you the best shots of celebrities using their handbags to do something other than store their iPhones.</p>
<p><strong>leather bags  women</strong> reached out with a statement from a company spokesperson that we added at the end of the article to clarify the policy change.</p>
<p>Last year we had quite a few major <strong>leather hobo bag</strong> rumors swirling around the wholesalers , and the biggest were about a price increase (which happened) and the <strong>fashion handbags</strong> Grand Shopping Tote’s possible discontinuation (more on this soon). Now the change that has <strong>handbag manufacturers</strong> fans at tPF up in arms is the brand’s new refurbishing policy.</p>
<p>It started as a rumor, but we’ve been able to confirm it: as of October 1st, 2015<strong> fashion handbag</strong> will no longer refurbish or refinish bags more than five years old, and the brand will not refurbish or refinish of any bag without proof of purchase. A poster on tPF brought this news forward in September, saying she heard it from a friend who had heard it from <strong>WRBags.com</strong> directly. Since then, customers and owners of <strong>leather bags for women</strong> bags have become incredibly upset about this change in policy, and the thread has now reached 24 pages and nearly 360 comments.</p>
<p>At first, posters were extremely skeptical; it seemed counterintuitive that a brand with a history of standing behind its products and taking care of its customers would take a step like this. After all, bags typically need repairs and refurbishing as they grow older instead of in the first five years after they’re purchased. But soon after the first tPFer mentioned it, customers started calling their own stores and repair departments to find out more.</p>
<p>Another poster said she spoke directly to the <strong>wholesale clutch handbags </strong>repair department at the New York City 57th Street location. This poster was told the new rule is that the repair department will no longer re-dye, clean, refurbish or condition any bag more than five years old. They will, however, continue to do other repairs due to normal wear and tear on handbags regardless of the bag’s age.</p>
<p>The five-year rule still seems stringent, especially when so many shoppers collect vintage <strong>shoulder handbags</strong>  as well. On top of it all, this ensures that the majority of people who buy their bags pre-owned on the resale market will not be able to take their bags in for refurbishment or repairs as they most likely do not have the original proof of purchase.</p>
