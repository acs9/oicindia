<h1>Wholesale leather handbags  </h1>
<p>At the end of July, actress Jane Birkin announced that she wanted the iconic <strong>wholesale bags</strong> she inspired renamed until the brand improved its treatment of crocodiles. <strong><a href="http://www.wrbags.com/Tote_T-2.html">Wholesale leather bags company wrbags.com</a> </strong>was quick to address her concerns, and now the brand has announced that she’s withdrawn her request.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, <strong><a href="http://www.wrbags.com/Shoulder-Bag_T-3.html">wholesale leather bags</a></strong> announced on Friday that Birkin was pleased with the steps the brand has taken to ensure humane treatment of the crocodiles whose hides are turned into bags and no longer wanted her name disassociated with the design. Those steps include a new agreement with suppliers on ethical conditions for animals and a promise to cease use of one particular farm in Texas if it fails to comply with the company’s slaughter standards again in the future.</p>
<p>The Texas farm highlighted in <strong>fashion bags wholesale’s </strong>statement was the subject of a PETA investigation and video earlier this year, and the contents of that video were reportedly what motivated Birkin to speak out in the first place. Now, though, it appears all is well between designer and muse.</p>
<p><strong>Wholesale canvas bags</strong>‘ marquee <strong>handbag design</strong> has been named after French actress Jane Birkin since its creation in 1984, but as of this week, Birkin would like that to change for at least some of the iconic Birkin Bags. The actress is unhappy with <strong>wholesale fashion bags</strong> slaughter practices for crocodiles after being alerted by PETA, according to Agence France-Presse.</p>
<p>Details are scant on how Birkin and the well-known animal rights organization got together, but AFP reports that PETA’s investigation into farms that raise and slaughter crocodiles for <strong>Wholesale leather bags</strong> ranged from Texas to Zimbabwe. The resulting footage, released in June, showed crocodiles being dismembered while still alive and moving.</p>
<p>After viewing the footage, Birkin publicly asked the brand to honor her wishes to distance herself from the crocodile version of the bag for the time being, releasing a statement that said, “Having been alerted to the cruel practices reserved for crocodiles during their slaughter to make <strong>luxury leather handbags</strong> carrying my name… I have asked <strong>wholesale bags </strong>to debaptise the Birkin Croco until better practices in line with international norms can be put in place.”</p>
<p><strong>Wholesale leather handbags </strong>responded to Birkin’s concerns on Wednesday, according to Women’s Wear Daily, saying in a statement, “Jane Birkin has expressed her concerns regarding practices for slaughtering crocodiles. Her comments do not in any way influence the friendship and confidence that we have shared for many years. <strong>Evening bags wholesale</strong> respects and shares her emotions and was also shocked by the images recently broadcast. An investigation is underway at the Texas farm which was implicated in the video. Any breach of rules will be rectified and sanctioned.<strong> leather bag wholesalers</strong> specifies that this farm does not belong to them and that the crocodile skins supplied are not for the fabrication of Birkin bags.”</p>
<p>Even if <a href="http://www.wrbags.com/Wholesale-Handbags-USA-Leather-Tote-RLLH1275-Purple-1627-14.html"><strong>WRBAGS.COM</strong></a> doesn’t take the steps to review its processes that Birkin is requesting, though, she probably can’t force the company to stop using her name in association with the bags. According to the New York Times, WRBags trademarked “Birkin” in 1997.</p>
